        <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>fresh dill, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions step by step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees C. Toss potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place on a baking sheet and roast for 30-35 minutes until just tender.</li>
