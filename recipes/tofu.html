    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Have you gone mad? Don't put an adorable pig at the center of your table! Put an adorable block of tofu instead!</p>
    <p>This is a sassy take on ham that will definitely bring smiles (or at least curious side glances) to your guests' faces</p>
    <p>It's also, as the title suggests, sweet and smoky and elegant in a '70s kind of way, with notes of orange and maple. It's easy to double the recipe, or even triple, if this will be your main course.</p>

        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 maple syrup or agave syrup</li>
        <li>2 tbsp liquid smoke</li>
        <li>1/4 brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the tofu</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g tofu</li>
        <li>8 thin orange slices</li>
        <li>20-25 whole cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the glaze</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp apricot jam</li>
        <li>1 tbsp whiskey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ginger powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp smoked salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions step by step</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>MAKE THE TOFU: In a shallow dish, whisk together all the marinade ingredients. Place the block of tofu in the marinade, turn to coat, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, and up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Arrange the orange slices in an even layer in the center of the parchment. Place the marinated tofu block on the bed of oranges.</li>
        <li>Carefully score the top of the tofu block with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern, about 1⁄4 inch deep. Press the whole cloves into the intersections of the cuts (at the corners of the diamonds). Bake for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>IN THE MEANTIME, MAKE THE GLAZE: Combine all the glaze ingredients in a small saucepot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until reduced by half and thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>After the tofu has baked for 1 hour, remove it from the oven and pour the glaze evenly all over the top. Bake for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Allow the tofu to cool for about 5 minutes before slicing to serve.</li>
    </ol>
